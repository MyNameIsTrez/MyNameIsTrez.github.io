Enemies sometimes completely stop moving once they're close to the player,
which means they can block all the other enemies from passing through them.
This means the player can survive indefinitely, which is a big problem.

Add waves of increasing numbers of enemies.

Give the player a gun?

Make a nice looking booleanWorld.js file that resembles houses or something.

Allow for walls to have different colors, depending on the tile's wall type.
This will be done by saving the map as a 2D integer array, representing whether a tile is empty, a wall, a water tile, etc.

Make the game a tower defense game/zombie survival shooter.

The player can't hit the right and bottom edge of the map in restricted mode,
the problem probably lies somewhere in controls.js.
