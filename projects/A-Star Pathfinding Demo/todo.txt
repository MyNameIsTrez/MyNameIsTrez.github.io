1.
Enemies sometimes completely stop moving once they're close to the player, which means they can block all the other enemies from passing through them.
This means the player can survive indefinitely, which is a big problem.

2.
Enemies can teleport to the player, once the player has died. This should be investigated, but I don't think it should be a priority.

3.
Add waves of increasing amounts of enemies.

4.
Give the player a gun?

5.
Make a nice looking booleanWorld.js file that resembles houses or something.

6.
Allow for walls to have different colors, depending on the tile's wall type.
