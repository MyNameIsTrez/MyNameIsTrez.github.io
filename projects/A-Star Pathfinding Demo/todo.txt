1.
Enemies sometimes completely stop moving once they're close to the player, which means they can block all the other enemies from passing through them.
This means the player can survive indefinitely, which is a big problem.

2.
Enemies can teleport to the player when enemies want to move into each other's positions. This can be seen when standing still when booleanWorld has been loaded.

3.
Add waves of increasing amounts of enemies.

4.
Give the player a gun?

5.
Make a nice looking booleanWorld.js file that resembles houses or something.

6.
Allow for walls to have different colors, depending on the tile's wall type.

7.
Make the game a tower defense game/zombie survival shooter.

8.
Make the player unable to see the entire world at once by implementing a render distance.
