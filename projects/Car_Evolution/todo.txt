--- EASY ---
- 

--- MEDIUM ---
- Clearly integrate the instructions into the program so the program also works in present-mode (in the URL).
- Enforce a minimum line distance between the corners so you can't create very small line dots.

--- HARD ---
- Lines can't be drawn on top of each other by using the same corners twice.
