I am feeling motivated to learn [Toki Pona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona) right now.

In order to keep myself motivated while learning the language, I am publishing my personal Toki Pona dictionary below, based on [this Toki Pona course](https://lipu-sona.pona.la/dictionary.html).

Because Toki Pona contains only about 120 words(!), this page is still relatively short.

In the spirit of Toki Pona, I try to describe every Toki Pona word with only a single English word. English words that have parentheses around them are special.

It is important to note that because I know zero Toki Pona right now, I don't recommend anyone else to use my translations, but rather to construct a similar dictionary of your own.
