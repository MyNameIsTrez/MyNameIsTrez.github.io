Right now I'm finally feeling motivated to learn the constructed language [Toki Pona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona).

In order to keep myself motivated, this post is sharing my personal Toki Pona, based on [this much better Toki Pona dictionary](https://lipu-sona.pona.la/dictionary.html).

Toki Pona contains only about 120 words(!), so that still keeps this page relatively short.

In the spirit of Toki Pona, I do my utter best to describe every Toki Pona word with only a single English word.

The English words with parentheses around them are ones I wasn't able to find a satisfying, short description for yet that doesn't rely on grammatical words like "interjection" or "particle".

Because I have zero knowledge of Toki Pona at the time of writing this sentence, it's a pretty bad idea to use this personal dictionary of mine to learn Toki Pona for yourself. Instead, I recommend you construct your own Toki Pona dictionary, which you can customize to contain the exact amount of detail you personally prefer.
