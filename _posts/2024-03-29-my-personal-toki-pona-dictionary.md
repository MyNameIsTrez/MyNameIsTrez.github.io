I am feeling motivated to learn [Toki Pona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona) right now.

In order to keep myself motivated while learning the language, I am publishing my personal Toki Pona dictionary below, based on [this Toki Pona course](https://lipu-sona.pona.la/dictionary.html).

Because Toki Pona contains only about 120 words(!), this page is still relatively short.

In the spirit of Toki Pona, my special rule is that every Toki Pona word may only be described with a single English word. Ones that have parentheses around them are special.

It is important to note that because I know zero Toki Pona right now, I don't recommend anyone else to use my translations, but rather to construct a similar dictionary of your own.
