Right now I'm finally feeling motivated to learn the constructed language [Toki Pona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona).

In order to keep myself motivated, this post is sharing my personal Toki Pona, based on [this much better Toki Pona dictionary](https://lipu-sona.pona.la/dictionary.html) and [this cheat sheet](https://blinry.org/toki-pona-cheat-sheet/toki-pona-cheat-sheet.pdf).

Toki Pona contains only about 120 words(!), so that still keeps this page relatively short.

In the spirit of Toki Pona, I do my utter best to define every Toki Pona word with only a single English word, but as you'll see it isn't always possible.

The English words with parentheses around them are ones I wasn't able to find a satisfying, short description for yet that doesn't rely on grammatical words like "interjection" or "particle".

Because I have zero knowledge of Toki Pona at the time of writing this sentence, it's a pretty bad idea to use this personal dictionary of mine to learn Toki Pona for yourself. Instead, I recommend you construct your own Toki Pona dictionary, which you can customize to contain the exact amount of detail you personally prefer.

As most of the words have several possible meanings, where the right meaning has to be gathered from the surrounding context, I'll be updating the definitions as I figure out which meanings are more common in practice.
