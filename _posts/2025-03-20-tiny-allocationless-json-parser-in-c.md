I wrote the library [Tiny allocationless JSON parser in C](https://github.com/MyNameIsTrez/tiny-allocationless-json-parser-in-c), which parses a subset of [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) in 469 lines of C. Only arrays, objects and strings are handled.

I wrote this JSON parser for my tiny programming language called [grug](https://mynameistrez.github.io/2024/02/29/creating-the-perfect-modding-language.html).

I was inspired by null program's [Minimalist C Libraries](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2018/06/10/) blog post, describing how C libraries never really need to allocate any memory themselves. The trick is to expect the user to pass `void *buffer` and `size_t buffer_capacity`:

```c
int main() {
    char buffer[420];

    // If json_init() fails, just increase the starting size
    assert(!json_init(buffer, sizeof(buffer)));

    struct json_node node;

    enum json_status status = json("foo.json", &node, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
    if (status) {
        // Handle error here
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    // You can now recursively walk the JSON data in the node variable here
}
```

Instead of using a fixed size buffer, you can use `realloc()` to keep retrying the call with a bigger buffer:

```c
int main() {
    size_t size = 420;
    void *buffer = malloc(size);

    // If json_init() fails, just increase the starting size
    assert(!json_init(buffer, size));

    struct json_node node;

    enum json_status status;
    do {
        status = json("foo.json", &node, buffer, size);
        if (status == JSON_OUT_OF_MEMORY) {
            size *= 2;
            buffer = realloc(buffer, size);
        }
    } while (status == JSON_OUT_OF_MEMORY);

    if (status) {
        // Handle error here
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    // You can now recursively walk the JSON data in the node variable here
}
```

## How it works

The `json_init()` function puts an internal struct at the start of the buffer [here](https://github.com/MyNameIsTrez/tiny-allocationless-json-parser-in-c/blob/eed044c1d1950a0df7707e197b4cf05a3520b11f/json.c#L534-L540). `json()` uses the remaining buffer bytes to allocate the arrays it needs for parsing [here](https://github.com/MyNameIsTrez/tiny-allocationless-json-parser-in-c/blob/eed044c1d1950a0df7707e197b4cf05a3520b11f/json.c#L462).

If one of the arrays turns out to be too small, it'll automatically restart the parsing, with the array's capacity doubled [here](https://github.com/MyNameIsTrez/tiny-allocationless-json-parser-in-c/blob/1e5dd1ae77e3f247f28026cc10abedd876aa43f0/json.c#L375-L376). So the first parsed JSON file will take a few iterations to be parsed successfully, while the JSON files after that will usually just take a single iteration.

The parser uses an [array-based hash table](https://mynameistrez.github.io/2024/06/19/array-based-hash-table-in-c.html) to detect duplicate object keys, and `longjmp()` to [keep the clutter of error handling at bay](https://mynameistrez.github.io/2024/03/21/setjmp-plus-longjmp-equals-goto-but-awesome.html).

The [JSON spec](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) specifies that the other value types are `number`, `true`, `false` and `null`, but they can all be stored as strings. You could easily support these however by adding just a few dozen lines to `json.c`, so feel free to. The `\` character also does not allow escaping the `"` character in strings.

## The old version that was smaller and simpler

Originally `json.c` was 397 lines of code, which you can still view in the branch called [static-arrays](https://github.com/MyNameIsTrez/tiny-allocationless-json-parser-in-c/tree/static-arrays):

```c
int main() {
    struct json_node node;
    if (json("foo.json", &node)) {
        // Handle error here
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    // You can now recursively walk the JSON data in the node variable here
}
```

It used static arrays with hardcoded sizes, which I described the advantages of in my blog post titled [Static arrays are the best vectors](https://mynameistrez.github.io/2024/04/09/static-arrays-are-the-best-vectors.html).

There were two problems with it:
1. It didn't give the user control over how the memory was allocated. So you'd have to manually edit `#define` statements in `json.c`, if you wanted to increase say the maximum number of tokens that a JSON file is allowed to contain.
2. Whenever `json_parse()` was called, its static arrays would be reset. This meant that calling the function a second time would overwrite the previous call's JSON result. This was fine if you didn't need to open more than one JSON file at a time, though. But even if you did, you could just manually copy around the arrays containing the JSON data.

Most of the work went into adding tons of tests to ensure it has as close to 100% coverage as possible; `tests.c` is almost as large as `json.c`! The tests also act as documentation. I've fuzzed the program with libFuzzer and documented it in [the repository](https://github.com/MyNameIsTrez/tiny-json-parser-in-c)'s README. Enjoy! ðŸ™‚
